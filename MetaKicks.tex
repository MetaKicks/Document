\begin{abstract}
\textit{As the culture of collecting expensive designer, luxury and limited-edition sneakers grows among the MZ generation – Millennials and Gen Z – LG’s internal research found that these ‘sneakerheads’ would benefit greatly from a solution that not only made their cherished shoes stand out more, but also provided them with the optimal care. and LG provides LG ThinQ applications to connect its home appliances and consumers and provide consumers with a better experience. So our team thought that it would be good to virtualize the ShoeCase and manage it on the ThinQ app. By storing nft sneakers in a MetaKicks, nft, which exists only virtually, is collected as if it were stored in a LG Styler ShoeCase. In addition, the limited edition of the shoe resell market has grown a lot, and we decided to create this service to check the resale market price of shoes in real time. Finally, we thought that the culture of collecting shoes could be further activated by taking out the shoe case that was only in my room on the web and creating a culture to share each other's shoes collections.}\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
Shoe cases so far are made of plastic and can only function as storage and display shoes. But The LG Styler ShoeCase creates the ideal environment for storing shoes by protecting against humidity and fabric-discoloring UV light, the Styler ShoeCase represents a great way for shoe enthusiasts to show-off their favorite pairs, offering interior features such as a 360-degree rotating turntable to increase the value as a collection rather than just shoes. 
Nft shoes are stored online, and real shoes are stored only in the shoe rack and managed separately. By using this, these two collections are managed by one app. We thought it would be good to share the collection, including nft shoes, with various people to further boost the shoe collection culture.
So we make this service by paying attention to the value of the collection. It check the fluctuating resell market price in real time using Kream or StockX's API, Korea and USA's leading sneakers trade site, and sharing each other's collections through this service.


\subsection{problem statement}
\begin{itemize}
\item In The case of limited-edition shoes, prices fluctuate significantly over time or depending on events, so collectors who own several shoes find it difficult to know the value of the collections at once.
\item The shoe case so far is just a plastic drawer. There is only a storage function and the function of the exhibition is inferior. There are many people who want to manage it like a proper collection.
\item NFT shoes can only be stored online or on a hard disk, and real shoes are in ShoeCase, so there is no means to manage both at once
\item It is very useful to use a LG Styler ShoeCase to manage sneakers. but there is no means to check the shoes stored at home outside.
\item You can't see other people's sneakers collection unless you go their home. In order for the shoe collection community to grow further, it is necessary to have the ability to see collections of many people
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research of any relative software}

{Kream} \\ It is a transaction brokerage platform that connects sellers and buyers anonymously. Similar to trading methods such as stocks and cryptocurrencies, it consists of presenting the price the seller wants to sell and accepting the price. Due to the nature of the asking price transaction, used goods are not handled because the premise that all items are the same is necessary. The main trading items are limited edition products such as clothing and fashion miscellaneous goods, and can be seen as a commonly referred to as a resale trading platform. Unlike general direct transaction platforms, products are traded through the KREAM inspection center. When the seller sends the product to the KREAM inspection center, the KREAM inspects it and sends it to the buyer.\\

{StockX} \\ It serves as an online marketplace, facilitating auctions between sellers and buyers, then collecting transaction and payment fees. Sellers send purchased items to StockX facilities for inspection and verification, then authenticated products are shipped to buyers. StockX features a "stock market-like" variable pricing framework and discloses price histories for specific items. StockX is most known for sneakers and streetwear but also carries other clothing and accessories such as handbags and watches.\\

{LG ThinQ} \\ A representative home appliance management app that provides smart home services based on AI. With this application, you can control not only home appliances, but also all parts of the house, as well as check product status and malfunctions anytime, anywhere. In a situation in which the market environment is rapidly changing from 'supplier-centered' to 'consumer-centered, LG is providing these services, believing that the role of AI technology has grown.\\

\section{Requirement Analysis}

\subsection{Login}
It supports Google login and Apple login by linking Firebase and React. If the login is successful, you will be taken to the main page.\\

\subsection{Main Page}
Users can check the functions in the app at once on the main page. \\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item My ShoeCase\\
    \item Finding Other User\\
    \item Favorite ShoeCase\\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{My ShoeCase}
My ShoeCase page visualizes LG Styler ShoeCase on the web. There is no Shoes in the first entry. There is a pop-up page that writes the name or serial number of the ShoeCase product, then a virtual ShoeCases will be created according to the number of rooms and size of the ShoeCase. A user can nickname the user's ShoeCase.
\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Register Shoes by Style Code: There is a button for registering shoes in each section of the ShoeCase. When the user clicks the button, a pop-up window appears, and the user can search style code on the shoes site and register the shoes. For NFT shoes, there is an NFT shoe registration button. When you click the button, a pop-up window appears, and if you enter NFT information for the shoes, you will be registered in the virtual shoe closet like normal shoes.
\\
    \item Registered Shoes Information: The name and real-time resell price of the shoes displayed on the virtual ShoeCase. When the user clicks the shoes, The product’s site will appear to show the information of shoes linking with the shoes site.
\\
    \item Public/Private Setting: There is a checkbox to determine to show the user's ShoeCase
\\
    \item The number of heart: Those who have seen user's ShoeCase and like it press the heart. Total number of hearts is displayed.
\\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Finding Other User}

Other people's ShoeCase is listed only for those allowed to reveal their ShoeCase. The list displays the user's name and the nickname of the ShoeCase. When the user clicks the name of the person the user wants to see, the page switches to the that person's ShoeCase page.
\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Search Someone's ShoeCase: You can search the user's nickname and view the published ShoeCase.
\\
	\item Recommendation: List ShoeCase by number of hearts. 
\\
\end{enumerate}

\\
\end{enumerate}

\section{DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT}

\subsection{Software development platform}
The development environment we chose is Windows and Mac. We developed it according to the operating system of each laptop, and built and operated the source code using the terminal functions of Windows and Mac. The front-end framework chose react-native and nodejs as the back-end development language. React-native is a cross-platform framework that can be developed simultaneously on Android and iOS operating systems, and it is the most popular front-end framework, so I chose it in the hope that it will be studied while working on the project. Nodejs is a run-time environment that allows you to run code that builds servers outside your browser based on JavaScript language, making it easy to expand servers and highly compatible with react-native, so we chose it as a back-end development language.\\

    \begin{tabular}{|p{2.4cm}|p{5.0cm}|}
	\hline
	Tools and Language & Reason\\
      \hline
       Javascript & JavaScript is one of the most popular web development programming languages. It is one of the components of the web today, along with HTML and CSS. Javascript can handle not only the front-end but also the back-end. Javascript is the basic programming language for React and Node.js. With one programming language, we can care for each other and review. Javascript is easy and fast to manage posts posted in real time. \\
	\hline
        MongoDB & MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data as JSON-like documents. MongoDB enables us to build applications faster than sql, handle highly diverse data types, and manage applications more efficiently at scale. MongoDB is also easy to process vast amounts of data. Metakicks will handle the data of many user's shoecase, handling a large amount of data is required.\\
	\hline
        Node.js & Node.js is a software platform used to develop scalable network applications. Node.js utilizes JavaScript as the writing language and has high processing performance through non-blocking I/O and single thread event loops. Node.js has the ease of server expansion and can even write back-end in the required front-end language of JavaScript. Also Node.js has a strong point in services that require processing a huge amount of input output data.\\
	\hline
	React-Native & React native is a framework for developing Android and iOS apps using React's grammar. React native also uses Javascript as a programming language, so it has good versatility. Hot Reload and Live Reload of React native allows us to immediately apply the correction and confirm the correction immediately.\\

\subsection{Software in use}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{KREAM}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{pics/KREAM.png}}\\
It is a transaction brokerage platform that connects sellers and buyers anonymously. Similar to trading methods such as stocks and cryptocurrencies, it consists of presenting the price the seller wants to sell and accepting the price. Due to the nature of the asking price transaction, used goods are not handled because the premise that all items are the same is necessary.

Unlike general direct transaction platforms, products are traded through the KREAM inspection center. When the seller sends the product to the KREAM inspection center, the KREAM inspects it and sends it to the buyer.\\
	\item{StockX}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{pics/StockX.png}}\\
StockX serves as an online marketplace, facilitating auctions between sellers and buyers, then collecting transaction and payment fees. Sellers send purchased items to StockX facilities for inspection and verification, then authenticated products are shipped to buyers. StockX features a "stock market-like" variable pricing framework and discloses price histories for specific items. StockX is most known for sneakers and streetwear but also carries other clothing and accessories such as handbags and watches.\\
	\item{LG ThinQ}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pics/LG.png}}\\
A representative home appliance management app that provides smart home services based on AI. With this application, you can control not only home appliances, but also all parts of the house, as well as check product status and malfunctions anytime, anywhere. In a situation in which the market environment is rapidly changing from 'supplier-centered' to 'consumer-centered, LG is providing these services, believing that the role of AI technology has grown.\\
	\item{GitHub}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pics/GitHub.png}}\\
It is a representative free git platform, and a small platform between teams. In Mark-down language, you can create the above key in Mark-down language, and highlight the important content. Through all documents and functions of the project, it improved work ability to share all documents and functionality. We will also use the branch function to complete the coding of each part and combine it if there is no problem.We will use github to share works with each other and proceed with development gradually. Development documents are also periodically attached in latex file format.\\
	\item{node.js}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.13]{pics/nodejs.png}}\\
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine (i.e. V8 engine) and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.We adopted Node.js as a backend system for developing applications. As for the front end, Node.js was considered suitable because React Native was selected in consideration of the interworking of JavaScript instead of flutter.\\
	\item{React-Native}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pics/React-Native.png}}\\
React Native is an open-source UI software framework created by Meta Platforms, Inc. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use the React framework along with native platform capabilities. We adopted reactive native as a front-end system for developing applications. As for the backend, Node.js was selected instead of flask in consideration of the interworking of JavaScript, so I thought react native would be suitable.\\
	\item{VScode}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.05]{pics/VScode.png}}\\
Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It can be used with various programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, Go, Node.js, Python, C++, C, Rust, and Fortran.Features include debugging, syntax emphasis, intelligent code completion, snippet, code refactoring, and embedded Git support. Users can install extensions that change themes, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and add additional features. VScode can utilize various languages, and we chose to take advantage of these VScode advantages.\\
	\item{Firebase}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pics/Firebase.png}}\\
Firebase is a back-end service that provides essential functions for the web and mobile development environment, and plays a variety of roles, including authentication functions that make Google account functions easy and Firestore functions that enable database functions. In this project, we mainly used the authentication function to facilitate the implementation of the Google login function.\\
	\item{mongoDB}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pics/mongo.png}}\\
MongoDB supports field, range query, and regular-expression searches. Queries can return specific fields of documents and also include user-defined JavaScript functions. Queries can also be configured to return a random sample of results of a given size. We will link the backend system Node.js with MongoDB. Among Nosql DBs, which can be said to be efficient when used with node.js, we intend to use Mongo DB, which is the most widely known.\\
	\item{Express.js}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pics/express.png}}\\
Express.js is a web framework based on the core modules of Node.js, http and Connect components. Express.js helps developers quickly and easily develop with Node.js. Middleware with various functions written in JavaScript code can be used by combining Express with only what developers need. We use express.js as a standard server framework. With express.js, we connect mongoDB and handle the database.
