\begin{abstract}
\textit{As the culture of collecting expensive designer, luxury and limited-edition sneakers grows among the MZ generation – Millennials and Gen Z – LG’s internal research found that these ‘sneakerheads’ would benefit greatly from a solution that not only made their cherished shoes stand out more, but also provided them with the optimal care. So LG has launched the LG Styler ShoeCase, which not only optimizes shoe management but also increases the value of collection and provides LG ThinQ applications to connect its home appliances and consumers and provide consumers with a better experience. So our team thought that it would be good to virtualize the ShoeCase and manage it on this project. NFT sneakers that exist only virtually are collected as if it were stored in a LG Styler ShoeCase with MetaKicks project. In addition, the limited edition of the shoe resell market has grown a lot, and we decided to create this service to check the resale market price of shoes in real time. Finally, we thought that the culture of collecting shoes could be further activated by taking out the shoe case that was only in my room on the web and creating a culture to share each other's shoes collections.}\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
Shoe cases so far are made of plastic and can only function as storage and display shoes. But The LG Styler ShoeCase creates the ideal environment for storing shoes by protecting against humidity and fabric-discoloring UV light, the Styler ShoeCase represents a great way for shoe enthusiasts to show-off their favorite pairs, offering interior features such as a 360-degree rotating turntable to increase the value as a collection rather than just shoes. 
NFT shoes are stored online, and real shoes are stored only in the ShoeCase and managed separately. By using this, these two collections are managed by one app. We thought it would be good to share the collection, including NFT shoes, with various people to further boost the shoe collection culture.
So we make this service by paying attention to the value of the collection. It check the fluctuating resell market price in real time using Kream or StockX's API, Korea and USA's leading sneakers trade site, and sharing each other's collections through this service.


\subsection{problem statement}
\begin{itemize}
\item In The case of limited-edition shoes, prices fluctuate significantly over time or depending on events, so collectors who own several shoes find it difficult to know the value of the collections at once.
\item The shoe case so far is just a plastic drawer. There is only a storage function and the function of the exhibition is inferior. There are many people who want to manage it like a proper collection.
\item NFT shoes can only be stored online or on a hard disk, and real shoes are in ShoeCase, so there is no means to manage both at once
\item It is very useful to use a LG Styler ShoeCase to manage sneakers. but there is no means to check the shoes stored at home outside.
\item You can't see other people's sneakers collection unless you go their home. In order for the shoe collection community to grow further, it is necessary to have the ability to see collections of many people
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research of any relative software}

{Kream} \\ It is a transaction brokerage platform that connects sellers and buyers anonymously. Similar to trading methods such as stocks and cryptocurrencies, it consists of presenting the price the seller wants to sell and accepting the price. Due to the nature of the asking price transaction, used goods are not handled because the premise that all items are the same is necessary. The main trading items are limited edition products such as clothing and fashion miscellaneous goods, and can be seen as a commonly referred to as a resale trading platform. Unlike general direct transaction platforms, products are traded through the KREAM inspection center. When the seller sends the product to the KREAM inspection center, the KREAM inspects it and sends it to the buyer.\\

{StockX} \\ It serves as an online marketplace, facilitating auctions between sellers and buyers, then collecting transaction and payment fees. Sellers send purchased items to StockX facilities for inspection and verification, then authenticated products are shipped to buyers. StockX features a "stock market-like" variable pricing framework and discloses price histories for specific items. StockX is most known for sneakers and streetwear but also carries other clothing and accessories such as handbags and watches.\\

{LG ThinQ} \\ A representative home appliance management app that provides smart home services based on AI. With this application, you can control not only home appliances, but also all parts of the house, as well as check product status and malfunctions anytime, anywhere. In a situation in which the market environment is rapidly changing from 'supplier-centered' to 'consumer-centered, LG is providing these services, believing that the role of AI technology has grown.\\

\section{DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT}

\subsection{Software development platform}
The development environment we chose is Windows and Mac. We developed it according to the operating system of each laptop, and built and operated the source code using the terminal functions of Windows and Mac. The front-end framework chose react-native and nodejs as the back-end development language. React-native is a cross-platform framework that can be developed simultaneously on Android and iOS operating systems, and it is the most popular front-end framework, so I chose it in the hope that it will be studied while working on the project. Nodejs is a run-time environment that allows you to run code that builds servers outside your browser based on JavaScript language, making it easy to expand servers and highly compatible with react-native, so we chose it as a back-end development language.\\

	Tools and Language & Reason\\
      \hline
       Javascript & JavaScript is one of the most popular web development programming languages. It is one of the components of the web today, along with HTML and CSS. Javascript can handle not only the front-end but also the back-end. Javascript is the basic programming language for React and Node.js. With one programming language, we can care for each other and review. Javascript is easy and fast to manage posts posted in real time. \\
	\hline
        MongoDB & MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data as JSON-like documents. MongoDB enables us to build applications faster than sql, handle highly diverse data types, and manage applications more efficiently at scale. MongoDB is also easy to process vast amounts of data. Metakicks will handle the data of many user's shoecase, handling a large amount of data is required.\\
	\hline
        Node.js & Node.js is a software platform used to develop scalable network applications. Node.js utilizes JavaScript as the writing language and has high processing performance through non-blocking I/O and single thread event loops. Node.js has the ease of server expansion and can even write back-end in the required front-end language of JavaScript. Also Node.js has a strong point in services that require processing a huge amount of input output data.\\
	\hline
	React & React is a Javascript library. React can be used to develop a single page application or a mobile application. React also uses Javascript as a programming language, so it has good versatility. With React, It can be extended to react native.\\

\subsection{Software in use}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{KREAM}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{pics/KREAM.png}}\\\\
It is a transaction brokerage platform that connects sellers and buyers anonymously. Similar to trading methods such as stocks and cryptocurrencies, it consists of presenting the price the seller wants to sell and accepting the price. Due to the nature of the asking price transaction, used goods are not handled because the premise that all items are the same is necessary.

When the seller sends the product to the KREAM inspection center, the KREAM inspects it and sends it to the buyer.\\
	\item{StockX}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{pics/StockX.png}}\\\\
StockX serves as an online marketplace, facilitating auctions between sellers and buyers, then collecting transaction and payment fees. Sellers send purchased items to StockX facilities for inspection and verification, then authenticated products are shipped to buyers. StockX features a "stock market-like" variable pricing framework and discloses price histories for specific items. StockX is most known for sneakers and streetwear but also carries other clothing and accessories such as handbags and watches.\\
	\item{LG ThinQ}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pics/LG.png}}\\\\
A representative home appliance management app that provides smart home services based on AI. With this application, you can control not only home appliances, but also all parts of the house, as well as check product status and malfunctions anytime, anywhere. In a situation in which the market environment is rapidly changing from 'supplier-centered' to 'consumer-centered, LG is providing these services, believing that the role of AI technology has grown.\\
	\item{GitHub}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pics/GitHub.png}}\\\\
It is a representative free git platform, and a small platform between teams. In Mark-down language, you can create the above key in Mark-down language, and highlight the important content. Through all documents and functions of the project, it improved work ability to share all documents and functionality. We will also use the branch function to complete the coding of each part and combine it if there is no problem.We will use github to share works with each other and proceed with development gradually. Development documents are also periodically attached in latex file format.\\
	\item{node.js}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.13]{pics/nodejs.png}}\\\\
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine (i.e. V8 engine) and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.We adopted Node.js as a backend system for developing applications. As for the front end, Node.js was considered suitable because React Native was selected in consideration of the interworking of JavaScript instead of flutter.\\
	\item{React}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=1]{pics/React.png}}\\\\
React is an open-source UI  Javascript library created by Meta Platforms, Inc. React uses Dirty checking and Virtual DOM to find the DOM element that needs to be updated and only updates that part, so it is possible to perform extremely fast on dynamic modern webs with frequent re-rendering. We adopted reactive as a front-end system for developing applications. As for the backend, Node.js was selected instead of flask in consideration of the interworking of JavaScript, so We thought React would be suitable.\\
	\item{VScode}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.05]{pics/VScode.png}}\\\\
Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It can be used with various programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, Go, Node.js, Python, C++, C, Rust, and Fortran.Features include debugging, syntax emphasis, intelligent code completion, snippet, code refactoring, and embedded Git support. Users can install extensions that change themes, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and add additional features. VScode can utilize various languages, and we chose to take advantage of these VScode advantages.\\
	\item{Firebase}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pics/Firebase.png}}\\\\
Firebase is a back-end service that provides essential functions for the web and mobile development environment, and plays a variety of roles, including authentication functions that make Google account functions easy and Firestore functions that enable database functions. In this project, we mainly used the authentication function to facilitate the implementation of the Google login function.\\
	\item{mongoDB}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pics/mongo.png}}\\\\
MongoDB supports field, range query, and regular-expression searches. Queries can return specific fields of documents and also include user-defined JavaScript functions. Queries can also be configured to return a random sample of results of a given size. We will link the backend system Node.js with MongoDB. Among Nosql DBs, which can be said to be efficient when used with node.js, we intend to use Mongo DB, which is the most widely known.\\
	\item{Express.js}\\
	\\
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pics/express.png}}\\\\
Express.js is a web framework based on the core modules of Node.js, http and Connect components. Express.js helps developers quickly and easily develop with Node.js. Middleware with various functions written in JavaScript code can be used by combining Express with only what developers need. We use express.js as a standard server framework. With express.js, we connect mongoDB and handle the database.

\section{Arcitecture Design and Implementation}
\subsection{Overall Architecture}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{pics/service_construct.png}}
Our MetaKicks site consists of frontend, backend, API, and DB. First, the user registers the shoes in the virtual shoe rack on the frontend page. In this process, users can easily find many kinds of shoes registered on the stockX homepage through API calls through name or style code search. Once you have found the shoes, press the heart button to complete the registration in the database.\\
The front end uses ReactJS to naturally switch the web screen using state. We used Express.js to facilitate the connection with MongoDB, the database we use, and applied stockX API to build a project that calls API when the client requests it from the server.\\

\subsection{Module 1 : Front End}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Purpose\\
\\\\To develop Metakicks, a platform where the user can see the uesr's and the other's shoecase on the web, we used React, a web framework developed through Javascript language. Since Metakciks is powered on the web, it can be accessed by url without a separate installation. React uses Dirty checking and Virtual DOM to find the DOM element that needs to be updated and only updates that part, so it is possible to perform fast on dynamic webs with frequent re-rendering. Metakicks used React because it is a web that renders only the part without changing the entire page when changing the screen. Also, there is the other advantage. Since React uses javascripts such as node.js and express.js, it has the advantage of using javascript for front-end and back-end development. If the developer knows Javascript, the developer can develop front-end and back-end. Therefore React was adopted as a front-end development environment to enhance the efficiency and develop more efficiently.\\\\
\item Functionality\\
\\\\Metakicks's front-end made with React requests existing JSON file in the database via the backend server to show the users their own shoecase and the other's shoecase. And the information received from the user is delivered to the back-end server and database. With front-end of Metakicks, the user can give their information to the back-end/database and the user can see the data from database with graphic rendering as well as the LG ShoeCase system. Users can get a better experience for Metakicks and LG from innovative idea of Metakicks.\\\\

		Product Card screen show the detail information and price of shoes.Product Card screen gets stockX data by requesting to the back-end. \\
	\end{enumerate}
\item Where it's taken from\\
\\\\JavaScript is an object-based script programming language. This language is mainly used within a web browser and has the ability to access embedded objects from other applications. Microsoft visual studio code is distributed free of charge. Therefore, it can be easily downloaded and updated. In Visual Studio Code, the user can write html, css, javacript code. Visual studio Code supports IDE(Various integrated development environments) and text editor. In addition, many modules with javascript can be easily installed through node.js. Installing node.js also easy. Node.js is also free program, so can be easily installed and updated. React is a javascript library, therefore with node.js, React program can be started.\\\\
\item How and Why We Used It\\
\\\\React is one of the JavaScript libraries used to create a user interface. React uses Dirty checking and Virtual DOM to find the DOM element that needs to be updated and only updates that part, so it is possible to perform fast on dynamic webs with frequent re-rendering. Metakicks' web renders only the part to be replaced on the main page without switching the screen so It is efficient to utilize React optimized for dynamic webs. React also use the Javacript as the programming language, so there is less pressure to study another programming language. The fact that the front-end programming language and the back-end programming language are the same gives developers great convenience. So Metakicks has unified front-end and back-end programming language to Javascript by using React.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Module 2 : Back End}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Purpose\\
\\\\Node.js is a platform that combines Chrome V8, an open-source JavaScript engine, with libuv, an asynchronous event processing library. In other words, Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to execute code, such as building a server outside a browser. With Node.js, the user can easily set the HTTP web server. In Node.js, a package manager called npm is available. The Node Package Manager (npm) is a package manager for JavaScript programming languages. With using npm, this makes it easy to install numerous packages. Express.js is a web framework based on the core modules of Node.js, http and Connect components. Express.js helps developers quickly and easily develop with Node.js. Middleware with various functions written in JavaScript code can be used by combining Express with only what developers need. Metakicks use Express.js as a server framework since Metakicks use Node.js as back-end environment. In addition, through node.js and express.js, mongodb can be the database of Metakicks because it supports the Node.js.\\\\
\item Functionality\\
\\\\Node.js includes a built-in HTTP server library, which allows the web server to operate without separate software such as Apache, allowing more control over the behavior of the web server. So we run the server through Node.js. The web framework was constructed light and flexible using express.js. In addition,mongoose are used to connect express.js and mongodb. Although Mongodb is a Nosql, database, schema can perform the same role as the sql's table through schema settings in mongoose. The shape of the data can set using the schema.\\\\
\item Location of Source Code\\
: MetaKicks\_Backend/\\\\
\item Class Components\\
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[-] routes/routes.js\\\\
		route.js is a frame that defines the form for each url of the web.\\
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[-] models/Metakicks.js\\\\
		Metakicks.js is the schema of the data. This set the schema of the mongodb data using mongoose.\\
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[-] controllers/Metakicks.controllers.js\\\\
		Metakicks.controllers.js controlls the data of shoes from shoes site. \\
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[-] scrapers/*\\\\
		This files scrape the data of shoes from other sites. The data are obtained in Json file format. \\
	\end{enumerate}
\item Where it's taken from\\
\\\\Javascript is available through the installation of visual studio code. Microsoft visual studio code is distributed free of charge, making it easy to access. Like visual studio code, node.js are also distributed free of charge. Node.js installation can be confirmed through the terminal of the visual studio code or from the command prompt, and if node.js installation is completed, express.js can be installed through npm. In addition, a javascript library called mongoose is required to connect express.js and mongodb. Mongoose can also be installed at npm of node.js.\\\\
\item How and Why We Used It\\
\\\\In the case of Node.js, since it is Javascript-based which is the most popular web programming language, many open-source modules and apis are available. Express.js is the web framework based on Node.js core modules. It has a great advantage on routing the web. With using express.js, we can easily controll the routing of web and organize web frameworks light and flexible. The middleware of various functions written in JavaScript code can be used in combination with Express by the developer selecting only what is needed. Javascript is the most famous web programming language and node.js and express.js use javascript so there are many community used by experts and senior programmers. We could take the advantage of strong community of popular programming language. Both front-end and back-end tools used the same programming language (javascript), so it was useful to communicate with each other. In addition, Metakicks took stockX's API because it had to get details such as shoe information and price from stockX, an external site.\\\\
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Module 3 : Database}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Purpose\\
\\\\MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented cross-platform database written in C++, with outstanding scalability and performance. It also maintains the top recognition among existing NoSQL databases. Metakicks used mongodb because it had data on personal shoecase for each user and had to be easy to expand the data. MongoDB also facilitates the use of json files because it uses dynamic schema-type documents in the form of JSON instead of a fixed structure with a schema such as MySQL's table. MongoDB Atlas is a cloud database that manages everything created by the architects of MongoDB. AWS, Azure, and GCP provide integrated management of everything related to deployment. With Mongodb Atlas, we can distribute the database easily. MongoDB Atlas also has a free version that can read and modify data in real time because it is a cloud system.\\\\
\item Functionality\\
\\\\MongoDB is Nosql, but schema can be set using Mongoose. Shema serves as a table for sql. We set the schema with mongoose and back-end request Json file of the user's shoecase, and import the user's showcase information from the mongodb database in Json file. By using the Mongodb Atlas, real-time communication between the front-end, back-end and database can be possible. By using free version, it allows users to give their information such as adding shoes in their shoecase and back-end server can receive those data. So user finally can see the rendered graphics of their shoecase. \\\\

\item Class Components\\

\item Where it's taken from\\
\\\\MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database system classified as NoSQL announced in 2009. Mongodb is being used in places such as Washington Post and Kakao Talk, which have a lot of data expansion and transformation. It is not a traditional table-relationship-based RDBMS like MySQL and does not use SQL. Mongodb uses a dynamic schema-type document in the form of JSON instead of a fixed schema-like structure, such as a table in MySQL. Mongodb can be downloaded free of charge from the Internet. Apart from installing mongodb, in order to use mongodb in node.js, the mongodb module must be installed using npm. Mongodb Atlas is a multi-cloud database service by the same people building MongoDB. Atlas simplifies database deployment and management while providing the diversity needed to deploy resilient, high-performance global applications from selected cloud providers. Originally, other programs are needed for distribution, but data management and distribution can be easily solved through mongodb atlas.\\\\
\item How and Why We Used It\\
\\\\There are SQL and NoSQL in the database, and choosing between them was not an easy decision. However, by using React as the front-end and node.js as the back-end, we decided to use Mongodb, which is easy to access as node.js as the database. Mongodb can be managed by Javascript through express.js and mongoose, which was in line with our intention to develop the front-end and back-end as javascript. Mongodb is Nosql, but metakicks has a fixed data format called shoecase for each user. Therefore, data with a format was stored through a schema that determines the form, such as the table of sql, through mongoose. We was worried about the distribution of the database, but fortunately, Mongodbatlas in Mongodb was a cloud that distributed, enabling real-time database management.\\\\
